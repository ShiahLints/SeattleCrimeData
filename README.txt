Seattle Crime Data

My roommate insists on locking the back door at night because she is convinced that people bread into houses at all hours of the day. I come from a part of the world where people lose the keys to there homes because they never use them. I decided to take a look at seattle data set to see how much crime is actually commited. 

The data set can be found at https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Data/4fs7-3vj5
